   <h1>conditional statements</h1>

    <h3>In Python, **conditional statements** allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. These statements help control the flow of your program. The most commonly used conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
</h3>
<div class="div">
<h2>if statement:</h2>

<h4>The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is true, the code block inside the `if` statement will be executed.
</h4>
<li>Syntax:</li>
<p>
if condition: <br>
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True <br>
</p>

<p>
x = 10 <br>
if x > 5: <br>
    print("x is greater than 5") <br> <br>
Output: <br>
x is greater than 5 <br>
</p>

<h2> else statement:</h2>
<h4>The `else` statement follows the `if` statement and runs if the condition in the `if` is false.
</h4>
<li>Syntax:</li>
<p>
if condition: <br>
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True <br>
else: <br>
    # Code block to execute if the condition is False <br>
</p>

<p>
x = 3 <br>
if x > 5: <br>
    print("x is greater than 5") <br>
else: <br>
    print("x is not greater than 5") <br> <br>
Output: <br>
x is not greater than 5
</p>

<h2>elif statement:</h2>
<h4>The `elif` (short for "else if") statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It follows an `if` statement and executes only if the `if` condition is false, but the `elif` condition is true. You can have multiple `elif` statements in a chain.
</h4>
<li>Syntax:</li>
<p>
if condition1: <br>
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is True <br>
elif condition2: <br>
    # Code block to execute if condition2 is True <br>
else: <br>
    # Code block to execute if all previous conditions are False
</p>

<p>
x = 10 <br>
if x < 5: <br>
    print("x is less than 5") <br>
elif x == 10: <br>
    print("x is equal to 10") <br>
else: <br>
    print("x is greater than 5 but not 10") <br> <br>
Output:
x is equal to 10
</p>

<h2>Nested if statements:</h2>
<h4>You can also have `if` statements inside other `if` statements. This is known as a **nested if**.
</h4>
<p>
x = 15 <br>
if x > 10: <br>
    if x < 20: <br>
        print("x is between 10 and 20") <br>
    else: <br>
        print("x is greater than or equal to 20") <br>
else: <br>
    print("x is 10 or less") <br> <br>
Output: <br>
x is between 10 and 20
</p>

<h2> Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):</h2>
<h4>In Python, you can use a conditional expression to evaluate a condition in a single line. This is also called a **ternary operator**.
</h4>
<li> Syntax:</li>
<p>
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
</p>

<p>
x = 7 <br>
result = "Positive" if x > 0 else "Negative" <br>
print(result) <br> <br>
Output: <br>
Positive
</p>

<h2>Summary of Conditional Statements:</h2>
<li>`if`: Tests a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.</li>
<li>`elif`: Checks another condition if the previous `if` (or `elif`) condition is false.</li>
<li> `else`: Executes a block of code if none of the conditions are true.</li>
<li> You can nest `if` statements inside one another.</li>
<li> Python also has a compact conditional expression using the ternary operator.</li>
